      "content": " Driven by mere curiosity about low-level 3D engines, I decided to start a side project to learn how to build an engine from scratch using graphic libraries such as OpenGL. Guided by online tutorials, I started with basic primitive plotting and went on implementing more and more complex concepts such as texture and model importing, shader programming, lights, and shadow mapping."
