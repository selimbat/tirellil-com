      "content": "For this project, the inspiration came from ~~a video made by Brackeys[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRpBWBkHvjU]~~ and led to this co-operative platform puzzle. The main mechanic of this game is that some platforms, crucial to finishing the level, change color once one of the players touches them and become useless for the other player. So you have to plan ahead before jumping around and have to restart the whole level from the beginning."
